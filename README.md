# go-sdk
This is the Go SDK for Plain's Core GraphQL API.

This repository will, in future, be the home for a Go SDK for Plain's GraphQL API. 

Currently this only provides all the types one needs in order to implement a customer cards API ([more info](https://www.plain.com/docs/customer-cards)).

There is also an example Go http server, implementing a customer card endpoint in [examples/customercards](/examples/customercards).

For more customer card examples, see [team-plain/example-customer-cards](https://github.com/team-plain/example-customer-cards).
